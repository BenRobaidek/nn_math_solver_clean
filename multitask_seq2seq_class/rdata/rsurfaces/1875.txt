I understand the concept but can not arrive at the correct answers I think I am messing up the last equation . I keep getting the number of adult tickets is 74 but I know that is not right . A movie theater charges NUMBER_0 dollars for adults , NUMBER_1 dollars for children , and NUMBER_2 dollars for seniors over age 60 . The theater sold NUMBER_3 tickets and took in NUMBER_4 dollars . If twice as many adult tickets were sold as the total of children and senior tickets , how many tickets of each kind were sold ?
