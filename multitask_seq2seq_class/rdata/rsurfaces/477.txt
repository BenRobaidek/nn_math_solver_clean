I am in the dark and I am counting my change . I ca n't turn on the light so I try to figure out how much money I have . I know that NUMBER_0 dollars in change , but I am going to the laundry so I need quarters . I remember that I have NUMBER_1 dimes and that the rest are quarters and nickels . I count my money , and I have NUMBER_2 coins . How many quarters and how many nickels do I have ?
