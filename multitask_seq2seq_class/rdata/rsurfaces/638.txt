Recently , the Texas Junior College Teachers Association annual conference was held in LOCATION_0 . At that time a taxi ride in LOCATION_0 was NUMBER_0 dollars for the NUMBER_1 NUMBER_2 of a mile and NUMBER_3 dollars for each additional NUMBER_4 of a mile . The distance from NUMBER_5 of the convention hotels to the airport is NUMBER_6 miles . If you were to tip the driver of the taxi NUMBER_7 % , how much would it cost to take the taxi from the hotel to the airport , in dollars ?
